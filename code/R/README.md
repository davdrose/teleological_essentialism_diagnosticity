# R Script

Data analyses and figures were generated using the script in `diagnosticity.Rmd`. `cache` contains the bayesian models that were run for each experiment. To reproduce all analyses and figures, simply fork the repository, open `diagnosticity.Rproj` in RStudio, load `diagnosticity.Rmd` and click `run all`.
