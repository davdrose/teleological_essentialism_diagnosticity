# Experiments 

- `experiments` contains code for each experiment that was run. All experiments were pre-registered and run in jsPsych. 
 - `experiment1` ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/2wb3e)). In this experiment, a bee was made to look like a spider, had bee DNA, and either made honey or spun webs.
 - `experiment2` ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/q6xdj)). In this experiment, two creatures were shown that had DNA cause a feature and purpose. Interventions were performed on the feature, purpose and DNA.
 - `experiment3` ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/rb8yt)). In this experiment, creatures were showm that had a causal mechanism generate a feature and a causal mechanism generate a purpose. Interventions were then performed on these mechanisms.
 - `experiment4` ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/3nshc)). In this experiment, category members had a particular causal mechanism implement a function. Exemplars were shown that had the same function implemented in a different causal mechanism than the category members or a different function implemented in the same causal mechanism as the category members.
